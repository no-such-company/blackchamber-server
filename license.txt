License for the use BlackChamber

[1] What is BlackChamber

BlackChamber (BC) is a server that ensures the transport of PGP protected content.
For this purpose, clear names are not used and the transport is mapped as far as possible via hash values.
To use this service special client programs have to be used.

[2] Responsibility

BC is mainly developed by Swen Kalski. However, from time to time he can add additional
developers to the development.

[3] Who may use BC

BC can be used by everyone. The API endpoints are protected in connection with the
specified PORT 1337 from the date of first release and may only be used if they match the
original system in scope and security promise.

[4] Cost

BC is funded by Swen Kalski and servers may be used by any private person. Swen Kalski and later companies,
which are financial supporters of BC and own BC as legal property, have the right to charge an annual license fee of 1024 €
to companies with a turnover of more than 10.000 € per year or a correspondingly high reputation or market value.
This licensing clause will be communicated to the companies concerned at least 6 months before it comes into force.

[5] further developments

Extensions of the server with the aim to create compatible systems are (if [4] applies) subject to the creation of this license.

The further development must not entail any weakening of the functionality consciously/unconsciously. In this case, the software may
not be marketed as a SMail/BlackChamber compatible system.
Failure to comply with this rule constitutes a violation of this license and obligates the operator/developer to discontinue the used
software under penalty of at least 40 annual licenses plus court costs.

[6] forks

forks with the purpose of developing a compatible competing product outside the Smail communication structure are
prohibited if they are created with the intent/unconscious purpose of evading a license.
Any revenue generated will automatically accrue to the developer of BC.

Fork is still allowed for private developers to create their own private structures not accessible from the internet.
